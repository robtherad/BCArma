# Bravo Company Mission Template

The master branch will always be the most up to date and stable version of the template. If you intend to make a mission, use the master version.

## Using the Template

Download as zip from GitHub using the button on the bottom right. Drop the main folder named "ADV_120[BC]Template_Robtherad.Altis" in your Arma 3 mission folder which should be a path similar to "C:\Users\Rob\Documents\Arma 3 - Other Profiles\robtherad\missions". If you would like to make a mission on an island other than Altis then change the suffix on the folder from .Altis to the suffix used by whichever map you intend to use. 

Now you should be able to open the 2D editor in Arma 3 and open the mission. Drag the playable units as well as the triggers and markers for the AO to the area you wish the mission to be played in. Then save the mission and test it.
