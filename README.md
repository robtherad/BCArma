# Bravo Company Mission Template

The master branch will always be the most up to date and stable version of the template. If you intend to make a mission, use the master version. This readme file has a lot of information but if you want to be able to navigate it easier then the [github wiki](https://github.com/robtherad/BCArma/wiki) might help.

# Questions

If you have questions about how a certain feature works the best way to find out is to go into the folder for that feature and read the file `readme.md` within it. The easiest way to read the readme files is to view them on GitHub but they are fairly easy to read in a text editor as well.

If you have other questions you can ask them in the #mission_dev channel on the [Bravo Company Discord](https://discord.gg/0Z9C1w0hrI8qqYSD).
