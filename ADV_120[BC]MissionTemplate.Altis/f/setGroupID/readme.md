#setGroupID
This module sets up groups with various variables such as names and types (`gpsmarkers`) as well as radio frequencies (`radios`).

###Configure
Each group is defined in a giant array at the top of the file. Each array is separated by a comma with the last array not having a comma after it. Each array uses the following format:

`[group,groupID,BC_LongName,unitSize,radioSettings]`

Each of the words above is explained below:

`group` is defined by placing a line similar to the following in the initialization field of every unit in that group: `Blue_A1 = group this;`.

`groupID` is a short string used to identify a group: `"A1"`

`BC_LongName` is a longer version of `groupID` used to identify the group: `Alpha One`

`unitSize` is a number telling what level the group is. Company = 3, Platoon = 2, Squad = 1, Fireteam = 0 (0-3)

`radioSettings`: Tells radio script which channels to set for group. 
Uses the format: `[altChannel,mainChannel,[channelArray]]` (array)

Each of the above is explained below:

```
mainChannel: Which channel the radio will start on. (1-8)
altChannel: Which channel the radio will have as an alternate by default (1-8)
[channelArray]: An array of channels to set on the radio. (float)
   channelArray is expressed as numbers which are added to playerBaseChannel (ch1) to determine which channel the radio will be on. 
   Try to keep offsets single digit or the channel may not be set if playerBaseChannel is a high number.
   Frequencies can only have one decimal place.
ex: [1,6,[1,2,3,4]] - mainChannel is ch1, altChannel is ch6, ch2 is 1 unit MHz higher than ch1, etc.
```
    
###Disable
In `'init.sqf'` remove the line `[] call compile preprocessFileLineNumbers "f\setGroupID\f_setGroupIDs.sqf";`.

###Other
If you see a message that says ```[setGroupIDs] No radio freq found for group - '[GROUP NAME]'``` it means that in your group definitions you have set the `mainChannel` variable to a number higher than the amount of values defined in that group's `channelArray`. This message is displayed when the ORBAT script `f\briefing\f_orbatNotes.sqf` is unable to display a frequency next to the name of the listed group.
