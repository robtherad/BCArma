Add a function for adding different types of objectives:
    [team, type, args, opposing team, (OPTIONAL) message] call bc_fnc_addObjective;
    
    [west, "Kill", obj3, east, "Destroy the enemy weapon's cache."] call bc_fnc_addObjective;
    
    Objective Types:
    
        "Kill" / "Destroy" - Eliminate supplied object. - "Defend"
        "Capture" / "Secure" - Remove all of the enemy from supplied location. - "Defend"
        "Escape" - Get all of the team to supplied location. - "Eliminate"
        
It should add the objectives using the BI task system as well as create all markers and add the objectives to the points system.


Track kills. Especially friendly fire kills. Display all friendly fire incidents in the bottom right of the player's screens.
