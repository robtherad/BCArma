#loadout
This module checks what unit type the player is spawned in as and then gives him a loadout corresponding to that type. All of the unit's initial gear is removed and then new gear determined by the unit's type as well as the script file corresponding to that type in the `units` folder. After this is done a briefing entry is generated by `f_loadout_notes.sqf` that shows the player what his gear will be when he loads into the mission.

###Configure
Edit the scripts in the `units` folder to match what you want players to have. If you don't know the class names of an item use the Virtual Arsenal (Under the Learn tab in the main menu) to find them. 
###Disable
In `'f\functions.hpp'` remove `postInit = 1` from the code block after `class loadout_set`.
